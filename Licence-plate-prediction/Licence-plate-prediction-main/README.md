Understanding the Automatic License Number Plate Recognition System
Automatic License Number Plate Recognition Systems are available in all shapes and sizes:

ANPR executed in measured lighting situations with predictable number plate types can utilize basic techniques for image processing.
More advanced ANPR systems use dedicated object detectors, like HOG + Linear SVM, SSDs, YOLO, and Faster R-CNN to localize license number plates in images.
State-of-the-art ANPR software uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) in order to aid in better OCRing of the text from the number plates themselves.
Even more advanced ANPR systems utilize specialized neural network architectures in order to preprocess and clean images before they are OCRed, thereby developing the accuracy of ANPR.
The fact that makes Automatic License Number Plate Recognition more complicated may require operating in real-time.

For instance, let us consider an ANPR system that is mounted on a toll road. It has to be able to detect the number plate of each vehicle passing by, OCR the characters on the plate, and then store this data in a database so the vehicle's owner can be billed for the toll.
